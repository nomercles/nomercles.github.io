                A la Recherche de Temps Perdu
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Proust!  Who I honestly mostly know from the Proust Questionnaire on <i>Inside the Actor's Studio</i>.
                    </li>

                        Translates to Remembrance of Things Past

                        Basically important because it deviated from plot-driven fiction of the 19th C. and meandered toward dreamy memoir.  Which basically means it was a blog.  It dealt a lot with the role of memory, but being as it was a French novel by a modern philosopher, it also did a lot of navel-gazing and analysis of various sociological concepts like class and perception and how our understanding of those things change as we polish our memories with nostalgia.

                Middlemarch
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        George Eliot, British, Victorian era novel.  (A lot of these are Victorian British novels written by white people).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        According to Virginia Woolf, it is "one of the few English novels written for grown-up people".  That seems a bit judgy, considering she was friends with Dickens.  I don't particularly <em>like</em> English novels of that era, but I'm still not going to tell my high school English teacher that <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> is for children.  That woman was scary.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Ulysses
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        James Joyce.  Drunken Irishman.  Eternally depressing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's kind of a spoof of <i>The Odyssey</i>, which shows up later on this list, basically turning all those characters into pathetic Dubliners.  It's got esoteric puns and references, but if you can follow those, it's supposed to be bitterly hilarious.  Yup, sounds like a drunken Irishman.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Really, the important thing here is that it's written in 18 very distinct and different "episodes".  Episode 14 parodies all the "great" British authors, from Chaucer to Dickens.  Episode 18 is 10,000 words smashed into just 2 very long run-on sentences.  The end of Episode 4 is a 10 page long elegantly delivered poop joke.  Also sounds like a drunken Irishman.

                Don Quixote
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        by Miguel de Cervantes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's a total shredding of chivalric ideals.  Sad ending, for some values of sad.  Whole book is a nice polite way of saying "what an idiot".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you've seen <i>The Man of La Mancha</i>, you've read Don Quixote.  Sort of.  And you'll get bonus Sophia Loren!
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                Moby Dick
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Herman Melville
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Call me Ishmael."  That's the first line.  That's also the most interesting line in the whole book.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Seriously, I got through 17 chapters, and they still hadn't loaded the damned boat.  I gave up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mostly, I know it's a novel about fruitless obsessionand how vengeance destroys your life if that's all you got going for you.  Get over it, move on, find another purpose.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Seriously, there is an <em>entire chapter</em> that is about nothing but <em>soup</em>.

                    <li>
                        Wait, I know this one!  Shakespeare!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I hate Shakespeare.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Except <i>Macbeth</i>.  If it was <i>Macbeth</i>, I'd have something to say.  I think this one has ghosts and a Danish prince?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                War and Peace
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Oh, boy.  Longest, most tedious book <em>ever</em>.  I still resent that I had to read any of it.  I am not good at this game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tolstoy.  Russian.  About as cheerful as a drunken Irishman.  Read at your own risk.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My mom has a copy of <i>War and Peace</i>.  It serves two purposes: it is a really great doorstop, and it is the book she hauls out when she's just been caught reading smutty romance novels.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The Odyssey
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Told you it would be on the list.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Greek epic!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Homer!  Not Simpson.  Homer the poet and philosopher and historian.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Okay, I actually read this one.  I didn't enjoy it much, because it was super misogynistic, but it was <em>hugely</em> influential.  If you want an understanding of both how to treat myth as reality, here's the thing for you.  It's a strong reminder that for the Greeks, the gods weren't just characters, they were <em>real</em>.  Scilla and Charybdis were genuinely a real fear, about as real a fear as terrorism is today.  Zeus wasn't just a horny silly dude we laugh at in 4th period English class, he was fully capable of seducing your wife and striking you dead in the process.  Imparts a sense of realism.

                    <li>
                        Didn't they just make a movie about this?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Super pretentious dude with delusions of grandeur decides to become someone else because he's obsessed with this chick who has no idea he's alive.  All about the ridiculous lengths some people go to to get laid.  Also all about the proverbial Nice Guy Who Isn't.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I didn't read this one, either.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Credited to F. Scott Fitzgerald, but considering his wife wrote it and he stole her work and then he locked her in an attic and gaslighted her, I'm gonna call that as nonsense.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Nearly got burned at the stake for writing it.  The Church was not pleased with him.  They thought it was sacrilegious, which to be fair, it kind of was.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It was also basically the first self-insert fanfic of the Bible.  Go figure.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                        Gustav Flaubert
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More French novelists.  I notice how none of the "great novels" on this list so far are written by anyone from Asia or Africa or Central or South America.  Just a whole bunch of white dudes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pampered housewife is bored, has a bunch of affairs and racks up mounds of debt to alleviate that boredom.

                    <li>
                        Frequent member of the Banned Books List.  Not terribly graphic by current standards, but it was <em>scandalous</em> at the time.  If I remember correctly, <i>Madame Bovary</i> was the married woman counterpart of <i>Fanny Hill's</i> prostitution story.  Neither of them are particularly kind to women.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                        Dostoyevsky
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        That means it is very long, very Russian, and very depressing.  A very large number of these books are terribly depressive.  Why that means they're important, I don't know.  There's a reason I like light and fluffy fanfic.  The world is already a sad place, and I don't need that much realism in my fiction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I think there's some judginess about atheism?  The virtuous brother is a good Christian, and the bad brother is an atheist?  I'm not sure, though.  It's the companion to <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, and as I had no desire to read that, I didn't bother with <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>.

                        Ah!  A book from someplace that isn't Europe or the US!  It's from Colombia!
                    </li>

                        Gabriel García Márquez

                    <li>
                        Basically the allegorial beginnings of Colombia, through the lens of the multi-generational story of the Buendía family, whose patriarch, José Arcadio Buendía, founds the town of Macondo, the metaphoric Colombia.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        More Homer.  Still not Simpson.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I had to read this one, too, but I mix it up in my head with <i>The Odyssey</i>.

                    <li>
                        Okay, I do actually have something to say about this one.  It's got some of the most beautifully spare and descriptive writing in English-language literature.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's also about pedophilia.  What makes it both horrifying and compelling is that it's told from the perspective of the pedophile.  He honestly thinks it's true love, and as he frequently forgets that he's infatuated with a 12-year-old girl, so do you.  And then you remember, and you get freaked out all over again.  He is a middle-aged man who starts lusting after a child, and then <em>marries her mother so he has access to her</em>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It was also one of the first novels that really introduced the unreliable narrator and the concept of the antihero.  Usually, the main character--especially if that main character is the narrator--is the hero of the story and the story is about them triumphing over various obstacles, but in this, you are <em>not supposed to like the main character</em>.  He's Woody Allen in literature form.

                    <li>
                        The last line is Romans 12:19, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay."  The first line is "Happy families are all alike.  Unhappy families are each unhappy in their own way."  Sounds fun.

                    <li>
                        Yup, that's about all I got.  It's very, very long.

                        I speak from personal experience, if you wallop someone with even a paperback copy, they will leave you alone.  Haven't read the book, but it makes a great weapon.

                        Deals with a once-rich aristocratic Southern family having to deal with the loss of self, loss of faith, loss of power, and loss of prestige as the world around them changes.  A lot of Southerners are still dealing with that, and it's 50 years after this book was written.  The South never seems to forget, even when it really needs to move on.

                        In a time when women did not write, and if they did, they wrote only frothy romances and such, <i>Wuthering Heights</i> dealt with physical and mental abuse in a particularly stark and honest way.  As a result, Emily Bronte was soundly criticized by everyone and was ostracized by the literary community.

                        Her sister, Charlotte Bronte, wrote <i>Jane Eyre</i>, which was much more typical of "women's" stories--restrained, romantic, lush, and with a happy ending.  As a result, <i>Wuthering Heights</i> was constantly compared until about 20 years after Emily's death, when people started to reevaluate and concluded that it was actually a technically superior novel, and they started describing it in rather sexist terms and saying that it was worthy of a man's labors.

                        It really ushered in the Gothic romance tradition--brooding hero, frightened governess, disturbing mystery, family secrets.

                        Considered the very first psychological novel, so basically the progenitor of the thriller genre.
