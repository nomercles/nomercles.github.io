        <img src="https://www.dominosugar.com/mm/images/frosting-starter-cupcakes.jpg" alt="7 cupcakes in a rainbow colored line" title="You can frost these cupcakes at home using almost any of the following frosting recipes!">
        <p>
            This is a basic collection of frostings.  Not quite everything you need to know, but it's a great place to start.  If you want to do specific frosting flavors, the internet will be more helpful than this will, but it's pretty simple to experiment with on your own.  And most of these recipes are buildable--they're the building blocks to other, greater confectionery recipes.  Whipped cream can become butter, meringue buttercream uses the same techniques as meringue which leads to pavlova, and ganache turns to truffles.  I don't cover things like fondant here, because fondant actually tastes pretty terrible, and there are lots of great manufactured alternatives available.

        <img src="http://s3.kenanaonline.com/photos/1150975512.jpg" height="300" alt="picture of colorless fluffy whipped cream in a stainless steel bowl" title="This is the perfect texture of homemade whipped cream.  And while it's not as fun as that gurgling noise when you spray it out of a can, it's both prettier and tastier.">
        <p>
            Whipped cream is the easiest thing in the world to make, and it almost always tastes better than the stuff in the can.  And just a couple steps further, and you can make your own butter, no churn required.  Here's how.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 C. heavy whipping cream
            </li>
            <li>
                1 tsp. sugar
            </li>
            <li>
                Optional flavorings, such as vanilla, liqueurs, even coffee or juice--about the same amount as the sugar, and adjust for taste as necessary
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Note: we really do mean <em>heavy whipping cream</em>, because the butter fat is the crucial element.  It'll also be a lot easier if you use superfine sugar, which is easily found in the baking aisle, or you can make your own from regular white table sugar by throwing it in the food processor or blender.  (And if you do that, you get a nice whiff of sweetness when you breathe in.  Bonus!)
        </p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Put your bowl and beater attachments in the freezer for at least 20 minutes.  Everything must be very, very cold.  (You can also do this with a stand mixer or by hand; in either case, put all your instruments in the freezer, and if you do it by hand, apologize to your forearms in advance).
            </li>
            <li>
                When you're ready, pour the ingredients into the bowl, and start whisking/beating on low.  In a few minutes, you can speed up your machines (don't bother if you're doing it by hand, you'll just be more miserable later) to medium.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you reach the point where if you lift the whisk/beaters the whipped cream holds its shape firmly, that's called "stiff peaks", and you can stop.  You know what whipped cream or Cool Whip looks like, aim for that.
            </li>
            <li>
                Voila, you have made whipped cream!
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Added note: if you want to use whipped cream as a frosting on a cake, you can!  Just get some gel stabilizer (you can find it craft stores and specialty stores and online) and add it as you're whipping.

This was just from whipping the cream about 10 more minutes.">
        <ol>
            <li>
                Making butter is only just a little bit harder.  Just keep whisking/beating.  Eventually, the product will get even thicker, kind of clotted and dense and harder to keep moving.  That's butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you work the whipped cream too far and it gets to that stage, don't worry.  It's still delicious, it's just a different texture.  If you're <em>actually</em> trying to make butter, you might want to use some salt and maybe some herbs instead of sugar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then roll it in some waxed paper and chill it for a while and you can slice it into butter pats.  Or you could just leave it in the bowl and scoop it out as you need it.  They also make molds for candies, and that's a nice, albeit finnicky, touch.
            </li>

        <p>
            This is the other really common frosting in the US, and the one you find on cinnamon rolls, carrot cake, and other spiced baked goods.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                4 oz. unsalted butter, softened
            </li>
            <li>
                4 oz. cream cheese, softened
            </li>
            <li>
                2 C. powdered sugar, sifted
            </li>
            <li>
                1 tsp. liquid flavoring (vanilla extract is most common)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, beat together the cream cheese and butter on medium-high speed with an electric mixer until creamy and light.
            </li>
            <li>
                With the mixer on low speed, add the sugar, 1 C. at a time, until smooth and creamy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the flavoring, and beat until fully incorporated.

        <img src="http://www.handletheheat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/How-to-Make-Ganache-01.jpg" height="300" alt="a vertical line of three stainless steel spoons of different consistencies of ganache" title="From top to bottom, this is truffle/frosting, glaze, and filling ganache consistencies.">
        <p>
            Ganache is a glaze, icing, sauce, or filling for pastries made from chocolate and cream, and while you can make any frosting into chocolate frosting by adding chocolate, ganache is the best.  It's versatile, as this recipe will show, and it easily turns into truffles, and who doesn't love that?  Each kind of ganache behaves differently, and each requires slightly different ratios of ingredients or preparation, so read carefully.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For ganache glaze, suitable for pouring over cakes or as a sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 C. heavy cream
            </li>
            <li>
                2 Tbsps. butter
            </li>
            <li>
                1 C. chocolate chips--milk, semi-sweet, or dark (you can also use white, but that's trickier and the internet will be most helpful there)
            </li>
            <li>
                2 Tbsps. brewed coffee (this is optional, but the darker the chocolate, the more of a positive impact it will have, so consider it)
            </li>
            <li>
                Pinch of salt
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For ganache filling or frosting</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 C. heavy cream
            </li>
            <li>
                2 Tbsps. butter
            </li>
            <li>
                2 C. chocolate chips, same as above
            </li>
            <li>
                2 Tbsps. brewed coffee
            </li>
            <li>
                Pinch of salt

        <ul>
            <li>
                1 C. heavy cream
            </li>
            <li>
                2 Tbsps. butter
            </li>
            <li>
                2 C. chocolate chips, same as above
            </li>
            <li>
                2 Tbsps. brewed coffee
            </li>
            <li>
                Pinch of salt
            </li>
            <li>
                1 Tbsp. corn syrup, optional
            </li>
            <li>
                Dutch process cocoa powder, for dusting
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add heavy cream and butter to a small saucepan and heat on low heat until the butter has melted and the cream has warmed throughout.  As with all chocolate work, do <em>not</em> rush this step.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add chocolate chips to a large glass or <em>nonreactive</em> bowl.  Pour the warmed cream and butter mixture over the chocolate chips.  Add in the brewed coffee and a pinch of salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow to stand for about 3-5 minutes to soften the chocolate chips completely, and stir briskly to combine and until smooth.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>For ganache glaze</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Allow to cool slightly, and the ganache will pour easily while still warm.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For ganache filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Once cooled to room temperature, ganache filling can be spread between layers of cakes, piped as filling into pastries, or sandwiched between cookies, etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For ganache frosting</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Once cooled to room temperature, use an electric mixer or a wire whisk, whip ganache to incorporate air and increase the volume of the ganache. Spread on cakes or other pastries as you would frosting.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For ganache truffles</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Add in corn syrup and/or liquid flavorings such as Grand Marnier liqueur at the same time as the chocolate chips, proceed accordingly
            </li>
            <li>
                Let cool in the refrigerator for several hours, until completely solid
            </li>
            <li>
                Scoop out spoonfuls of ganache and roll between your hands, or use a melon baller to form the truffles, like you would cookie dough
            </li>
            <li>
                Put truffle balls back into the fridge, to solidify again after the warmth of your hands
            </li>
            <li>
                Toss each truffle in the cocoa powder until coated

        <p>
            This is the most common, and probably easiest, traditional cupcake frosting in the US.  Go ahead and color it with food coloring or flavor it with pretty much anything you want.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                12 oz. softened, unsalted butter (if you're looking for a pure white frosting or a purer color from the food coloring, use an equal amount of Crisco)
            </li>
            <li>
                1 pound confectioner's sugar, sifted (it eliminates clumps and makes for fluffier frosting)
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 tsp. whatever liquid flavoring (vanilla is most versatile, and if you use extracts, use pure extracts)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Beat butter (or Crisco) on medium-high speed with electric mixer until pale and creamy, about 2 minutes
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce speed.  Add sugar, 1/2 C. at a time, beating after each addition, about 5 minutes.  (Hint: turn off the mixer when you add the sugar, unless you have a shield on the bowl, or else you'll have powdered sugar fly everywhere).
            </li>
            <li>
                Every other sugar addition, increase speed to high for 10 seconds, then reduce speed back to medium-high and continue as before.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add flavoring, and beat until smooth and fully incorporated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use immediately, or store covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.  If refrigerated, beat on low speed until it's smooth before using.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Yields about 4 C.

That's because it's a custard-based frosting, and it uses both whole eggs and egg yolks!">
        <p>
            This is kind of the transitional step between a very simple American buttercream frosting and a more complex and technical meringue buttercream, so it's great for getting your toes wet.  It has a thick texture, and isn't really stable enough for piping, but it tastes terrific.  It's also unique among frostings in that it's a <em>custard</em> based frosting!  At the end of the recipe at the link above, there are further instructions and links to making other recipes and flavorings, including a recipe for making caramel for caramel frosting.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium pot, bring the milk to a simmer along with the vanilla bean pods. Turn off the heat and set aside to steep for at least one hour, or as long as time allows.  (The longer it steeps, the more complex and developed the flavor will be).
            </li>
            <li>
                After steeping, remove the vanilla bean pods and use a rubber spatula to extract the thick vanilla goo from inside each. Return the milk to a simmer. Meanwhile, whisk together the sugar, reserved vanilla bean scrapings, cornstarch, eggs and yolks in a medium bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk about a half cup of the hot milk into the egg mixture—it will be thick at first but will loosen as the milk incorporates. Continue whisking in hot milk until the egg mixture is fluid and warm. Now, return the tempered egg/milk mixture back into the pot of hot milk, whisking all the while. Turn the heat to medium and whisk until the mixture begins to thicken and bubble sluggishly. From that point, continue whisking and cooking for a full minute more; use a timer or you run the risk of not fully cooking out the cornstarch. When the minute is up, pour the custard into a large mixing bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                The custard may be cooled quickly by mixing it continuously in a stand mixer. If time isn’t an issue, you can press a layer of plastic wrap against its surface and refrigerate until cool. You can wait even so long as overnight or a few days.  You <em>must</em>cover it, though, or else it will develop a skin, and that will ruin the entire custard.
            </li>
            <li>
                Either way, once the custard has cooled completely, use a hand or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment to beat it on medium to medium high speed until creamy. (If you did not refrigerate the custard, please do take caution to make sure you’re not rushing things; if the custard has not been mixed long enough to cool to perfect room temperature, the butter will melt in the next step and you’ll have a very soupy mess on your hands.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the cooled custard has been whipped until creamy, begin adding in the butter, one tablespoon at a time. Add the salt and continue to whip until the mixture is creamy and homogenous.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you’d like to flavor the buttercream with any extracts, melted chocolate or other flavorings, now is the time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use immediately or refrigerate until needed. When ready to use, whip until creamy before proceeding.
            </li>

If you learn only one frosting, make it this one.">
        <p>
            This is one of the slightly more complicated buttercream frosting recipes.  It's an excellent choice if you want a more refined, silken texture, and it's very popular on fancier cakes, as it comes out almost perfectly white.  It is also the first recipe that requires actual cooking, and we'll be expanding on some of the lessons learned here in our final recipe.  It's best if you make this one with an electric mixer or stand mixer.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1-1/2 C. unsalted butter, <em>cold</em>, or Crisco if you want a white frosting
            </li>
            <li>
                5 egg whites
            </li>
            <li>
                1 C. granulated sugar
            </li>
            <li>
                A pinch of salt
            </li>
            <li>
                2 tsp. vanilla extract, and if you want a white frosting, use clear vanilla extract
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Remove butter from the refrigerator and cut into tablespoon-sized pieces.  Leaving the butter out as you work on the next few steps gives it just the right amount of time to soften slightly (touching it will leave a tiny indentation) while still ensuring that it is quite cold.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place egg whites, sugar, and salt in a double boiler or the bowl of a stand mixer over a pot of boiling water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk constantly until the eggs reach 160 F according to a candy thermometer (the temperature necessary to kill salmonella in raw eggs).
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat and, in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk on high speed for ten minutes or until the bowl cools to room temperature. If the bowl feels at all warm, keep whisking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Switch to the paddle attachment and, on medium speed, beat in the butter one tablespoon at a time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn the mixer up to high speed and keep beating until the frosting is light and fluffy. During this process, the gorgeous meringue will suddenly deflate and may look soupy or curdled. Just keep mixing and eventually it will come together again and become beautiful frosting (this can take up to ten minutes).  Top tip: keep a shield or a towel or something over the bowl during this process, to avoid spattering or spilling.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix in vanilla.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use immediately, refrigerate in an airtight container for up to one week, or freeze for up to 2 months.  Allow refrigerated or frozen buttercream to come to room temperature and then beat until it becomes light and fluffy again before spreading or piping on cakes.  Store cakes frosted with Swiss meringue buttercream in the refrigerator, but always bring to room temperature before serving.

        <p>
            Every buttercream has its devotees, but this is my personal favorite.  It's incredibly stable, doesn't taste as much like butter as other buttercream frostings, and it has a luscious texture.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                2 cups sugar (375g), divided in half
            </li>
            <li>
                2/3 cup water (150g)
            </li>
            <li>
                5 large egg whites (150g)
            </li>
            <li>
                pinch salt, optional
            </li>
            <li>
                pinch cream of tartar, optional.  This is for stabilization, but if you're using a copper bowl, you'll get a chemical reaction that stabilizes the meringue and you don't need it.
            </li>
            <li>
                2 cups butter, cubed (4 sticks or 1 pound), cool but not cold
            </li>
            <li>
                2 teaspoons vanilla extract
            </li>
            <li>
                For a chocolate variation: 1 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate, melted but not hot
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                You want to make sure that you have everything measured out and ready to go. This recipe is simple but it does require seamless execution. You also want to make sure that your mixing bowl is clean and free of any residual fat, or your meringue will not whip up and there will be sadness abound.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix half of the sugar with the water in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stir just until the sugar dissolves. When the pan heats up, brush around the sides of the pot with a clean pastry brush dipped in water to dissolve any sugar crystals adhered to the sides of the pot. You can also use a paper towel that you roll up (I did because I forgot my brush at school.)
            </li>
            <li>
                When your sugar starts to bubble begin whipping your egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. You can add a pinch of salt and/or cream of tartar for stability if you wish. I only used salt in the photos you see. When your eggs begin to look frothy, slowly begin adding the second half of the sugar, whipping constantly on medium-high.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue whipping your egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Ideally your meringue should reach stiff peaks at the same time that your sugar syrup reaches 235˚F. If your egg whites are whipping too fast, reduce the mixer speed to medium. You can also adjust the heat on the sugar syrup to make it cook faster or slower.
            </li>
            <li>
                To test your syrup you can either use a candy thermometer or you can do it the old-fashioned way, which is what I did here. Take a tiny bit of the syrup on a spoon and dip it into ice water, reach in and grab the sugar. If it dissolves, it isn’t close to ready; if it forms a little malleable ball, it’s ready.  This is called "soft ball stage".
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn your mixer up to high and SLOWLY pour the sugar syrup down the side of the bowl. Be very careful not to hit the whisk. Ideally you should pour it in one solid stream down the edge because it will solidify where it hits the bowl, so if you pour it in three different places, you will be losing sugar. Sadness.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep whipping the Italian meringue on high until it forms stiff, but what is more important than the stiffness of the meringue is the temperature of the meringue. Before you begin adding the butter, the bottom of the bowl should feel barely warm.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the bowl feels just slightly warm, switch to the paddle attachment and begin adding your butter a piece at a time. I take my butter out of the fridge when I begin measuring my ingredients. Before adding each piece squeeze the butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue to beat the butter in on medium-high until the buttercream is smooth and there are no remaining pieces of butter. At this stage I switch back to the whisk, add my flavorings and beat it until it is light and fluffy. Pipe or spread as desired.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the chocolate variation: When your butter has been completely incorporated, pour your chocolate in all at once and immediately fold it in with a spatula or beat it in with the paddle attachment. You want to make sure that your chocolate is melted but not hot and it is also still warm enough to flow freely in a continuous stream. If your chocolate is too hot, you will melt your butter cream; but if it is too cool, then you will have pieces of chocolate in your frosting.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            To refresh refrigerated buttercream: Throw it in the mixer and beat with the paddle attachment until smooth; then switch to the whisk to whip it up until light and fluffy.  To refresh frozen buttercream: Thaw in the refrigerator overnight, let warm slightly at room temperature and then proceed with the refreshing refrigerated buttercream instructions above.

It is utterly delicious, however, and you just have to keep its base color in mind when you tint it.">
        <p>
            This buttercream does use uncooked eggs, so be aware of that.  However, you can use pasteurized eggs, and that will extend its shelf life and eliminate any health concerns you might have.  This recipe will give you a much yellower final product, and is much softer and creamier, making it less suitable for piping.  (Really, for piping, Swiss meringue is your best choice).
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                6 egg yolks at room temperature
            </li>
            <li>
                1 cup granulated sugar
            </li>
            <li>
                1/4 cup water
            </li>
            <li>
                4 sticks (1 lb.) unsalted butter
            </li>
            <li>
                2 tsp vanilla extract or paste, or other flavoring of your choice to taste--paste flavorings offer a more intense flavor, like the difference between dried and fresh herbs
            </li>
            <li>
                1/4 tsp table salt
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Put your 6 room temperature egg yolks into the bowl of your stand mixer. Beat on medium-low speed until the yolks have thickened slightly and are paler in color. This takes about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, put the sugar and water into a saucepan and cook on a high heat until a candy thermometer registers 240°F. If you don’t have a candy thermometer, you are looking for the “soft ball stage.” At this stage, a little sugar syrup dropped into cold water will form a soft ball. When the ball is taken from the water, it will flatten in your hand after a few seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the egg yolks are slowly whipping and the sugar is reaching 240°F, cut your butter into chunks and leave to soften at room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the water and sugar has reached 240°F, turn the mixer to low speed and slowly pour the syrup on the egg yolks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once all the syrup has been poured on the egg yolks, turn the mixer to medium-high and whip until the bowl no longer feels warm to the touch. This can take 10 to 15 minutes. Do not continue to the next step if your bowl still feels at all warm.
            </li>
            <li>
                When your mixing bowl is neutral to the touch, the egg yolk and sugar mixture should be thick, creamy and pale yellow in color.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add vanilla extract or paste, or other flavoring of your choice, plus the salt. Whip briefly to incorporate.
            </li>
            <li>
                At this point, your butter should be slightly softened. It should yield to a press of the finger, but not be completely soft. Turn your mixer to medium-low and start slowly adding the butter, one chunk at a time. This can take up to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue to whisk at medium-low speed until the butter is incorporated and no lumps remain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scrape down the sides of the bowl, turn the mixer to high and whip the buttercream for a final 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                This buttercream can be refrigerated for five days, frozen for two months and kept at room temperature (72°F) for one day.

Truly a showstopping dessert.">
        <p>
            Pavlovas are named for a Russian ballerina, Anna Pavlova, because they are light and airy, just like her dancing, and the dessert is very popular in Russia and Australia.  It consists of a baked crispy meringue shell with a marshmallow-y interior, and in this case, lemon curd and fresh berries, topped with whipped cream.  It is a much more in-depth recipe than any of the previous, but it builds on all of those techniques and makes for a show-stopping and elegant dessert.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For the pavlova</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                4 large egg whites with no traces of yolk, at room temperature
            </li>
            <li>
                Pinch fine salt
            </li>
            <li>
                1 cup granulated sugar
            </li>
            <li>
                2 teaspoons cornstarch
            </li>
            <li>
                1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the blackberries</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 cup sugar
            </li>
            <li>
                1/4 C. water
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 C. of your favorite spirit (I like Cointreau or red wine); for a non-alcoholic version, replace this with orange juice
            </li>
            <li>
                4 pints blackberries
            </li>
            <li>
                Pinch of salt
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>To assemble</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 cup fresh whipped cream
            </li>
            <li>
                1 cup lemon curd (if you prefer to make your own, the link has instructions for that)
            </li>
            <li>
                1-1/2 cups drunken blackberries
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h4>For the pavlova base</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the oven to 250°F and arrange a rack in the middle. Using a 9-inch round cake pan, trace a circle onto a piece of parchment paper with a pen or marker. Flip the paper over and place it on a baking sheet (the traced circle should be visible); set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the egg whites and salt in the very clean, dry bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a clean, dry whisk attachment. Whisk on medium speed until the whites begin to lighten in color and only small bubbles remain, about 2 minutes. Increase the speed to high and very slowly add the sugar in a thin, continuous stream. Whisk until firm, shiny peaks form, resembling marshmallow crème (this is the meringue), about 3 minutes.
            </li>

                Remove the bowl from the mixer and sift the cornstarch through a fine-mesh strainer into the meringue. Drizzle with the vinegar and vanilla and fold them into the meringue with a rubber spatula until no streaks of vanilla remain, being careful not to deflate the whites.

                Using the rubber spatula, pile the meringue into the center of the circle drawn on the parchment paper and smooth it to the edges of the circle to form a rough, even disk about 1 inch tall, with a slight dip in the center. (If the parchment shifts while spreading the meringue, weigh down two opposite corners with small, heavy objects like cans. Make sure to remove them before baking.)

                Bake until the meringue is firm to the touch but slightly soft in the middle, about 60 minutes. Remove from the oven, place the baking sheet on a wire rack, and let cool completely. Run a thin metal spatula under the meringue to loosen. Carefully slide it onto a serving platter or cake stand; set aside.

        <h4>For the drunken berries</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine sugar and water in a saute pan with high enough sides to hold all your berries. Bring to a boil and allow to cook without stirring until mixture just starts to caramelize.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the sugar is still very blonde, add your spirit of choice and stir to incorporate.  (And we mean that literally.  Sugar darkens as it cooks.  You want platinum, Marilyn Monroe blonde here.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow this mixture to boil together for a couple minutes. Add your berries and the salt, stirring to coat the berries in the thick sugar. Let cook for 10 minutes or so, stirring frequently until the berries become 'jammy.' The easiest way to test to see if they are ready is to take a dab of the juice from your pot and drop it on a plate, allow to cool for a minute or so and feel it between your fingers. You're looking for a nice sticky sugar but it shouldn't feel like you've glued your fingers together. (If it does feel too stiff, just add a little more booze to the mix!)
            </li>
            <li>
                Cool in the refrigerator until you're ready to use.  Do NOT use warm!
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>For alternative sober berries</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Using a potato masher or the back of a wooden spoon, mash 1 cup berries with sugar and orange juice in a large bowl until sugar begins to dissolve.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gently stir in remaining 5 cups berries; let sit at room temperature, tossing occasionally, until berries are juicy, 1-2 hours.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>For assembly</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Once the meringue is dry and slightly crunchy to the touch, it is ready for assembly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread the lemon curd over the top of the entire pavlova shell, like you're icing a in between layers of a cake.
            </li>
            <li>
                Layer the berries into the well in the pavlova shell, spreading them to the edges.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the rest of it with whipped cream, so that you can see all the various layers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Alternatively, pile the berries directly onto the pavlova shell, mix the lemon curd and whipped cream together, and spread the lemony whipped cream on top, making 2 layers instead of 3.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately.  Pavlova does not keep well.
            </li>
        </ol>
